# Getting-And-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
### submitted by Abhey Kumar, 03 June 2017

#### This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, performs the following steps:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* The result of all the steps is written in the file tidydata.txt.

#### The Code Book contains the relevant information about the variables in the data set.
